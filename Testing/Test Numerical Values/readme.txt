# ASSERTING NUMERICAL VALUES

Using assert_equal:
assert_equal(expected, actual, message)

Here, if the actual value does not equal the expected value, then the optional
message is displayed and the assertion fails. It can sometimes help to offer
some valuable information about the test case in the message.
